#Sliding Subarray Beauty
#Given an integer array nums and an integer k, the beauty of a subarray is defined as the 
# x-th smallest integer in the subarray where x is equal to the given integer.
#If there are fewer than x elements in the subarray, the beauty is defined as 0.
#Return an integer array containing the beauty of each subarray of size k in the order they appear in nums.
